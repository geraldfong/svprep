      <h3>Price Matching Policy</h3>
      <p>
        If you find a competitor program offering the same class offered at Silicon Valley Prep for a cheaper price, contact us at contact@svprep.org and we will match the price and give you an additional discount on top of it. We value your support, and will always give you the cheapest price.
