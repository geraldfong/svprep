              <p>
                We offer your students the highest quality attention through not only our classes, but instructors will hold office hours for students to come in and receive 1-on-1 feedback and attention.

              <h3>Simply Put: We Care</h3>
              <p>
                Our classes are taught by people who are not only experienced in their subject but also have a deep understanding of how to teach others. Silicon Valley Prep heavily emphasizes the importance of having our instructors understand our culture of commitment to students. All of our teachers will deliver only the highest quality educational experiences.

              <h3>Excellent Peer Instructors</h3>
              <p>
                Don’t settle for other programs who hire 50 year old teachers that haven’t seen the material in over 30 years. At Silicon Valley Prep, we only hire instructors that students can relate to and have had deep recent exposure in the subject.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our instructors have won National Debate Tournaments, published articles in prestigious newspapers, received multiple job offers from companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and hail from universities like Stanford, Yale and UC Berkeley.

              <h3>Innovative Courses for Innovative Times</h3>
              <p>
                Silicon Valley Prep recognizes that we’ve entered a new era. Our courses reflect our deep commitment towards preparing our students for the future. We teach classes like Introduction to Programming in Java, Public Speaking, and Debate & Argumentation.
