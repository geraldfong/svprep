              <p>
              "Every single parent knows the importance of improving their children's public speech skills. Therefore, I believe many parents in the Bay Area have sent their children to some sort of extracurricular classes before, and I'm one of them. Here are my key observations of how the SVPrep programs make a difference: 
              </br></br>

              <strong>1. Passion.</strong> The young teachers at SVPrep have shown their strong passion to pass their successful learning experience to their students. They went the extra mile and used their personal time to work with individual students, which you usually do not see in other summer programs. 

              </br></br>
              <strong>2. Age difference.</strong> All teachers are so young that they really understand their students while their students find easier to interact with their teachers. Meanwhile, the teachers still have authority that students follow their instructions."

              <h3>Simply Put: We Care</h3>
              <p>
              Our classes are taught by people who are not only experienced in their subject but also have a deep understanding of how to teach others. Silicon Valley Prep heavily emphasizes the importance of having our instructors understand our culture of commitment to students. All of our teachers will deliver only the highest quality educational experiences.

              <p>
              We offer your students the highest quality attention through not only our classes, but instructors will hold office hours for students to come in and receive 1-on-1 feedback and attention.

              <h3>Excellent Peer Instructors</h3>
              <p>
              Don’t settle for other programs who hire 50 year old teachers that haven’t seen the material in over 30 years. At Silicon Valley Prep, we only hire instructors that students can relate to and have had deep recent exposure in the subject.
              </p>
              <p>
              Our instructors have won National Debate Tournaments, published articles in prestigious newspapers, received multiple job offers from companies like Google, Facebook, and Twitter, and hail from universities such as UC Berkeley and MIT.
