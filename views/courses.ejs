          The main purpose of this contest-prep mathematics is to spur interest in mathematics and to develop talent through the excitement of solving challenging problems in a timed multiple-choice format. The problems range from the very easy to the extremely difficult. The MathCounts and AMC contests are intended for everyone from the average student at a typical school who enjoys mathematics to the very best student at the most special school.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course will be focused on preparing students to do well on the MathCounts and AMC 8 examinations. Students will be taught contest-based problem solving, which will emphasize thinking outside the box and quick problem solving strategies that are not taught within the realm of the classroom. Course topics will be covered in context of problem solving and will be geared towards the MathCounts and AMC tests rather than regular coursework that students will learn in their classes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This course will be broken up into two sessions. Students are encouraged, but not required, to sign up for both.
